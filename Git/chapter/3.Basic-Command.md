## Git Workflow and Commands

### Cloning a Repository

**Cloning**

-   Cloning a repository means creating a copy of a remote repository on your local machine.
-   **Command:** `git clone <repository_url>`
-   **Purpose:** Downloads the entire repository, including its history, to your local machine.
-   **Example:** `git clone https://github.com/user/repo.git`

### Checking the Status of Your Code

**Status**

-   The `git status` command is used to display the state of the working directory and the staging area.
-   **Command:** `git status`
-   **Purpose:** Shows which changes have been staged, which haven’t, and which files aren’t being tracked by Git.
-   **Output includes:**
    -   **Untracked:** New files that Git does not yet track.
    -   **Modified:** Files that have been changed but not yet staged.
    -   **Staged:** Files that have been added to the staging area and are ready to be committed.

### Understanding File Status

**Untracked**

-   New files that are not being tracked by Git.
-   **Scenario:** You create a new file or directory in the repository.
-   **Solution:** Use `git add` to start tracking these files.

**Modified**

-   Files that have been changed but not yet staged.
-   **Scenario:** You edit an existing file in the repository.
-   **Solution:** Use `git add` to stage these modifications.

**Staged**

-   Files that have been added to the staging area and are ready to be committed.
-   **Scenario:** You use `git add` to stage new or modified files.
-   **Solution:** Use `git commit` to commit these staged changes to the repository.

### Making Changes and Committing to a Repository

**1. `add`**

-   Before committing changes to a Git repository, you need to stage them. Staging is done using the `git add` command.
-   **Command:** `git add <file_name>`
-   **Purpose:** Adds new or changed files in your working directory to the Git staging area, preparing them to be included in the next commit.
-   **Example:** `git add index.html`

**2. `commit`**

-   After staging the changes, you commit them to the repository. Committing records the changes in the local repository.
-   **Command:** `git commit -m "commit message"`
-   **Purpose:** Creates a snapshot of the changes in the staging area with a descriptive message, making a permanent record in the project history.
-   **Example:** `git commit -m "Add new feature to index.html"`

### Pushing Changes to a Remote Repository

**Push**

-   The `git push` command is used to upload local repository content to a remote repository.
-   **Command:** `git push origin <branch_name>`
-   **Purpose:** Transfers the commits from your local repository to the remote repository.
-   **Example:** `git push origin main`

### Summary of Basic Git Commands

-   **Initialize a new repository:** `git init`
-   **Clone a repository:** `git clone <repository_url>`
