# Introduction to Git and Github
## History of Git
Git was developed in 2005 by Linus Torvalds, the creator of the Linux operating system kernel. The need for Git arose when the Linux kernel community required a distributed version control system (VCS) to manage the numerous changes and contributions efficiently. Prior to Git, the Linux kernel development used a proprietary VCS, BitKeeper, which led to concerns about dependence on proprietary software for an open-source project. This prompted Torvalds to create Git, focusing on speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows.

## What is Git?
- Git is a distributed, open-source version control system (VCS) designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. 
- It allows developers to store code, track revision history, merge code changes, and revert to earlier versions when necessary. 
- Git's design supports collaboration and version control in software development, enabling teams to work on code simultaneously without overwriting each other's contributions.

## Key Features of Git
- Popular: Widely used by developers and companies globally.
- Free and Open Source: Git is available for free and its source code is open to the public.
- Fast and Scalable: Designed to handle projects of all sizes efficiently.
- Distributed: Each developer has a full copy of the repository, including its history, providing redundancy and collaboration benefits.

## Git Basics
**Repository**
- A repository (or "repo") is where Git stores your source code and its full development history locally. It contains all the files and metadata necessary for your project.

**Branch**
- A branch is a parallel version of your code. Branches allow you to work on different features or fixes independently from the main version. Commonly used branches include the main (or master) branch for the stable version of the code and feature branches for new developments.

**Commit**
- A commit is a snapshot of your changes. Each commit records the state of the repository at a particular point in time. Commits are identified by a unique hash and include a commit message describing the changes.

**Merge**
- Merging is the process of combining changes from different branches. Once your work on a branch is complete, you can merge it back into the main branch. Merging incorporates the changes and maintains a cohesive project history.

**Diff**
- A diff is an operation that compares changes between commits. It highlights what has been added, removed, or altered. Diffs are essential for code reviews and understanding the impact of changes.

# GitHub 
- GitHub is a web-based platform that uses Git for version control. It is a cloud-based platform used to store code.
- It provides a collaborative environment for developers to host and review code, manage projects, and build software together. 
- GitHub extends Git's functionality with features like pull requests, issues, and GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD).

## Key Features of GitHub
- Repositories: Host and manage code in public or private repositories.
- Pull Requests: Propose changes to the codebase, enabling code review and discussion before merging.
- Issues: Track tasks, enhancements, and bugs with issue tracking.
- Actions: Automate workflows with CI/CD pipelines.
- Collaborative Tools: Facilitate collaboration with wikis, project boards, and team management.
