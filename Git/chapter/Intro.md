# Introduction Git and Github

## History Of Git
- Git was developed in 2005 by the Finnish software engineer Linus Torvalds, who is also credited with developing the Linux operating system kernel.
- 
## What is Git?
- Git is a distributed, open-source version control system (VCS) that enables you to store code, track revision history, merge code changes, and revert to earlier code version when needed.As the name suggests, version control is all about controlling and tracking different versions of a given project. 
- Companies from Google to Netflix and numerous others in between all use Git as a standard part of their tech stacks. Gitâ€™s ubiquity is so pronounced that for any software or code-related project, you can assume Git is part of the process. 
- Git Basics
    - Git stores your source code and its full development history locally in a repository. You can create a copy of    your source code, known as a branch, which you can then work on in parallel to the main version. When you are ready, you can commit changes to save your progress. Or you can merge your branch back into the main version. Every time you commit, Git takes a snapshot of your work and compares it to previous versions with a viewable operation called a diff. If there's been a change from previous commits, Git stores a new snapshot in the repository.

## Github 
- GitHub is a cloud software development platform. 
- It is commonly used for saving files, tracking changes, and collaborating on development projects. 
- In recent years, GitHub has become the most popular social platform for software development communities. Individuals can contribute to open-source projects and bug reports, discuss new projects and discover new tools.
